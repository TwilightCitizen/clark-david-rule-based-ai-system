## Part 1: Prompting the AI for Project Ideas

### Prompt(s) Supplied

> I am working on a Python school project to create a very simple Artificial Intelligence (AI) system based on rules or heuristics that a user can operate simply from a console/terminal. This is for an assignment to demonstrate how simple AI systems worked before the advent of Machine Learning (ML). Please suggest some project ideas for a simple console/terminal rule-based AI system. You may include examples like chatbots, recommendation systems, or diagnostic tools, but I would prefer simple games like Hi Lo, One Player Blackjack, Guess My Number, and similar.

### Ideas from GPT Responses

- Guess My Number: The computer picks a random number, and the user tries to guess it. The AI gives hints like "higher" or "lower" based on the guess.

- Hi-Lo Game: The AI presents a number, and the user guesses if the next number will be higher or lower. The AI uses rules to determine win/loss.

- One Player Blackjack: The user plays a simplified version of Blackjack against the computer, with the AI following basic rules for "hit" or "stand".

- Rock, Paper, Scissors: The user plays against the computer, and the AI follows the standard rules to determine the winner.

- Simple Chatbot: A rule-based chatbot that responds to user inputs with pre-defined answers or patterns (e.g., greetings, simple questions).

- Animal Guessing Game: The AI asks yes/no questions to guess the animal the user is thinking of, using a decision tree of rules.

- Basic Medical Symptom Checker: The AI asks about symptoms and suggests possible conditions based on rule-based logic.

- Simple Recommendation System: The AI recommends a movie, book, or activity based on user preferences using if-else rules.

- Text Adventure Game: The user navigates a simple story or dungeon, with the AI responding to commands using rule-based logic.

- Tic-Tac-Toe: The user plays against the computer, with the AI following basic strategies and rules.
